                <p>Whether you are fresh into a new position or a seasoned employee, there is always room for
                    improvement. It has nothing to do with your performance or abilities in general, but simply that you
                    can achieve so much more. You are in control of your work destiny, no one else. That raise you've
                    been wanting, or that promotion you've had your eye on can be yours. You just have to work for it.
                </p>



                <p>Managers and supervisors already have an enormous amount of work to do and the last thing they want
                    to have to worry about is if their employees are getting things done. Learn to be self-sufficient.
                    Don't sit around waiting for the next task or project to be assigned to you, go out and find it. If
                    you come across something that you don't have time for right now, make note and go back to it when
                    do you have extra time. Keeping your work flow at a constant pace helps keep you steady. If your
                    work flow or tasks are erratic, that can affect your work style.</p>



                <p>Staying busy is good, but don't over do it. If you already have five projects that you are juggling
                    and your manager comes to you with something new, be honest. It is OK to tell your manager you have
                    enough on your plate. If the new project is a higher priority, confirm with your manager that it is
                    OK to put off one of the lower priority projects to make time. If you are overwhelmed, the quality
                    of your work is sure to reflect it, which reflects poorly on you.</p>



                <p>If you are juggling multiple tasks or projects, master the art of scheduling and prioritizing. If you
                    have a handful of projects and one of them is significantly smaller or less involved, try knocking
                    that project out first. Not only does this mark something off your to-do list, but it will boost
                    your productivity by satisfying your sense of accomplishment. Likewise, if you have a large project
                    with multiple tasks, start small and work your way up the list. Complete what you can and move on to
                    the next task.</p>



                <p>It happens to everyone. Mistakes. They are a part of life, but sometimes they are the best learning
                    experiences. When you make a mistake doing something, you tend to remember that mistake, and
                    ultimately, not make it again. Learn from your mistakes. Ask yourself, what could I have done to
                    avoid the mistake. Also, own up to the mistake. Trying to ignore it or blame it on someone else ends
                    up coming back to bite you. If you own up to it immediately, you can (hopefully) fix it, learn from
                    it and move on to something else.</p>



                <p>Earlier I mentioned getting a raise or promotion. Neither of these things are required or guaranteed
                    in a position. They are rewards or incentives for a job well done. They are not given; they are
                    earned. If you want a raise or promotion, you have to work for it. Don't work 9 to 5 every day doing
                    only what has been asked of you. Come in a little early or stay a little late to get some work done
                    on that big project that your manager has given to you. Being on time and reliable is one thing, but
                    being available and dependable is another.</p>



                <p>With all the hard work you've put in, it doesn't hurt to relax a little. Remember to take a break
                    every now and then during the day. Get up, stretch your legs, get some coffee, whatever you need to
                    do to give your mind a rest. Something as simple as walking down the hall and chatting with a
                    coworker for a minute. Anything to stimulate your mind in a different way. If you're starting to
                    feel burned out on a project, switch to something else. Sometimes powering through a project can do
                    more harm than good.</p>



                <p>A job is work, but it doesn't have to always feel that way. If you are passionate about what you do,
                    and put your best self into it, great things will happen. If you put in the hard work and extra
                    effort, there is no reason you shouldn't get that raise or promotion you've been working for.</p>
