                <p>Working in tech for half of my life and tinkering in tech for almost all of it, I've dabbled in a
                    little bit of everything. Working in Help Desk and learning corporate IT to managing multiple
                    systems as a Systems Admin up to oversight at an executive level. My knowledge is always expanding
                    and I'm always trying to learn something new.</p>



                <p>Over the last few years I've been heading down the path of Linux, more from a server side. I've
                    always been a Windows guy as that is widely used both in business as well as residential. But Linux
                    was something I didn't have as much exposure to and wasn't very well versed in. I knew some basic
                    commands and could navigate the GUI of the basic distros, but I knew there was so much more.</p>



                <p>I started my journey with a simple Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu Server. I tinkered with the Pi for basic
                    projects like a game system emulator, a NAS to store some files and even a Plex server to steam my
                    media library. I read article after article and followed guide after guide trying to learn as much
                    as I could. I'd go down rabbit holes on some projects that would take me weeks of tinkering before I
                    finally got it working just right.</p>



                <p>Over time, I collected a few more PI's, until the shortage hit, and even took an old desktop and
                    installed Linux on it. Slowly I was building my own little network of devices and some of them were
                    even useful. I had to start labeling things with IP addresses and hostnames and draw a network
                    diagram of everything so I could easily see what I had and how it was connected.</p>



                <p>The more I dabbled, the more I added. Then I found out about Docker. Talk about a rabbit hole! That's
                    been the path I've been on for the last year or so. I've containerized all the things and even
                    recently migrated a bunch of containers from one server to another, and it actually went pretty
                    well. I've added so many cool things to my infrastructure, PiHole for DNS, Wireguard for VPN,
                    Duplicati and UrBackup for backups, WordPress for websites, Uptime Kuma to monitor everything and
                    even a dashboard with Homepage so I can easily access everything.</p>



                <p>Working with Docker I quickly learned how much easier it was to setup and recreate services using
                    Docker Compose. That even led me into learning Git and setting up code repositories for all my
                    different services to keep track of the projects and the changes I was making. This was honestly the
                    hardest part for me as I'm simply terrible at documentation. But I've identified that weakness and
                    I'm working on it.</p>



                <p>I've learned so much in such a short time that I simply can't believe only a few years ago I was
                    tinkering with a single Raspberry Pi in the basement. I've found so many great tech folks out there
                    on YouTube sharing tons of great knowledge. <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/"
                        class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Jeff Geerling</a>, <a href="https://technotim.live/"
                        class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Techno Tim</a>, <a href="https://networkchuck.com/"
                        class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Network Chuck</a>, and <a
                        href="https://christianlempa.start.page/" class="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Christian
                        Lempa</a> are just a few of the many out there. If you have any interest in learning anything
                    tech related, do yourself a favor and give them a look. As I continue on my journey, I'm excited at
                    the thought of all the other things I'm going to uncover and learn.</p>
